 Build 3 endpoints:
○ POST /register
○ POST /login
○ POST /refresh-token
● Store users in DB.
● Generate:
○ Access token (expires in 1 minute)
○ Refresh token (expires in 7 days)
● When the access token expires, the user calls /refresh-token to get a new one.
Logic needed: hashing passwords, JWT generation, refresh token lifecycle.
